# Lung Disease Classification and Interpretation with SHAP
## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the process of building a neural network model to classify lung disease images into four categories: COVID-19, NORMAL, PNEUMONIA, and TUBERCULOSIS. It also includes a model interpretation section using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to visualize the feature importance and determine the most influential disease in the dataset.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
SHAP
ImageDataGenerator from TensorFlow/Keras

## Dataset
The dataset should be structured in directories for each class of images:

Lungs Dataset/
    COVID-19/
    NORMAL/
    PNEUMONIA/
    TUBERCULOSIS/

## Steps
### 1. Data Loading and Augmentation
Use ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation and loading. Split the data into training and validation sets.

### 2. Model Building
Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras.

### 3. Model Training
Train the model on the training data and validate it on the validation data.

### 4. Performance Visualization
Plot training and validation accuracy and loss.

### 5. Model Prediction
Predict the class of a single image.

### 6. Model Interpretation with SHAP
Use SHAP to interpret the model's predictions.

### 7. Determine Most Influential Disease
Identify the most frequently predicted disease (excluding NORMAL).

## Conclusion
This notebook provides a complete workflow for building, training, and interpreting a CNN model for lung disease classification. The SHAP library is used for model interpretation to understand which parts of the images are most influential in the model's decision-making process.
